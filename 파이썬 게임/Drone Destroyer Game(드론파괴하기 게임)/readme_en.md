# Drone Destroyer Game

## üéÆ Game Description

"Drone Destroyer" is a 2D arcade game developed using Python and the Pygame library. Players control a launcher on the left side of the screen to fire missiles and destroy drones flying in from the right. Missiles follow a parabolic trajectory influenced by gravity, and hitting a drone results in an explosion effect and points.

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

## üìÅ Code Structure

The project is organized into the following main files and directories:

*   `drone_game.py`: Contains the main game logic, initialization, event handling, and game loop.
*   `src/config.py`: Defines general game settings such as screen dimensions, colors, and FPS.
*   `src/missile.py`: Defines the Missile class, handling its physics (gravity, velocity), movement, and rendering.
*   `src/drone.py`: Defines the Drone class, managing drone spawning, movement, rendering, and collision detection with missiles.
*   `src/explosion.py`: Defines the Explosion class, responsible for the animation and visual effects of explosions upon impact.
*   `src/ui.py`: Manages and renders in-game user interface (UI) elements, including score, launch angle, and speed display.
*   `src/ai_launcher.py`: (Optional) May contain logic related to an AI launcher. Currently not implemented.
*   `assets/`: Stores image files used in the game, such as the background, launcher, drones, and missiles.
